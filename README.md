In this course I better understood these concepts:

- To create a CSS variable `â€”variable-name: value;`;
- Gradients in CSS are a way to transition between colors across the distance of an element.
- `repeating-linear-gradient` makes the colors of your gradient repeat until it gets to the bottom of the element;

## Conclusion

My current goal is to master React, but first I need to complete some begginer courses on FreeCodeCamp, but at the same time I'm learning some new things like I pointed above.
